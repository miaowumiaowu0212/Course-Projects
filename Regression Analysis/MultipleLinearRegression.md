# APM 630 Regression Analysis

## Project #1 â€“ Multiple Linear Regression

### Data: MotorDeath.xls

The data on the number of driving deaths were collected from the 49 States and DC in 1964. The description of the variables is:

#### (1) ID variable

- **State**: the name of the States.

#### (2) Dependent variable:

- **Deaths**: dependent variable the number of motor vehicle deaths in 1964.

#### (3) Predictor variables:

- **Drivers**: the number of drivers in each state x 10^(-4).
- **People**: the number of people per square mile.
- **Mileage**: the total mileage of rural roads x 10^(-3).
- **Maxtemp**: the normal maximum temperature in January.
- **Fuel**: the highway fuel consumption in gallons x 10^(-7).

### Assignment:

1. Compute descriptive statistics for all variables.
2. Compute correlations among all variables.
3. Draw a matrix scatterplot of Deaths and five predictor variables.
4. Fit the full model (including the 5 predictor variables) to the data.
5. Summarize the model fitting for the full model (e.g., coefficient estimates, statistical testing, STB, R^2, adj R^2, RMSE, PRESS, AIC, BIC, etc.).
6. Select a "BEST" model using the stepwise selection method (SLE=0.10 and SLS=0.05).
7. Summarize the model fitting for the best model (e.g., coefficient estimates, statistical testing, STB, R^2, adj R^2, RMSE, PRESS, AIC, BIC, etc.).
8. Compare the "BEST" model with your FULL model (model fitting statistics, significance of the coefficients, etc.).
