# Course Projects

This repository contains course projects, code files and related datasets that I completed during my Master in Applied Statistics and PhD in Mathematics stages. The projects cover a wide range of topics within data analysis, statistical machine learning, and statistical modeling.

## Platforms

- **DataCamp**: Includes exercises and projects completed on DataCamp platform, focusing on practical data science skills.
- **DataQuest**: Similar to DataCamp, this section contains completed exercises and projects that emphasize hands-on learning in data science and analysis.

## Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Applied Statistics Coursework**: Course-related projects and exercises during my Master's.
- **Mathematics PhD Projects**: Research and study projects related to my PhD in Mathematics.
- **DataCamp Projects**: Practical projects completed on the DataCamp platform.
- **DataQuest Exercises**: Hands-on exercises and mini-projects from DataQuest.

This collection serves not only as a personal portfolio but also as a resource for others interested in data science, statistical modeling, and applied mathematics.
